### About Me

I'm Kai Aizen, a **GenAI Researcher** at **ActiveFence** and the security researcher behind **SnailSploit**. My work is focused on offensive AI security, where I identify and disclose novel vulnerabilities (CVEs) in complex AI/ML systems. I am inspired by the hacker ethos of creative problem-solving and apply it to the new frontier of artificial intelligence.

### ðŸ“Œ Core Projects

* **[AATMF (Automated Adversarial Threat Modeling Framework)](https://github.com/aatmf)**: An open-source framework for systematically identifying vulnerabilities in AI and LLM systems. This project is currently under consideration for inclusion within the OWASP Foundation.
* **Adversarial Minds**: My upcoming book exploring advanced strategies for AI red teaming, exploitation, and defensive engineering.
* **[The Jailbreak Chef](https://thejailbreakchef.com)**: A creative exploration into the art and science of prompt engineering and LLM manipulation.
