### About Me

I'm Kai Aizen, a **GenAI Researcher** at **ActiveFence** and the security researcher behind **SnailSploit**. My expertise lies in offensive security, with a focus that spans **Generative AI**, **Cloud-Native (Kubernetes)**, and **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**. I actively identify and disclose novel vulnerabilities (CVEs) in complex systems, applying the hacker ethos of creative problem-solving to uncover critical weaknesses.

### üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Disclosures (CVEs)

My research has led to the discovery and disclosure of the following security vulnerabilities. Detailed information and Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) can be found in their dedicated repositories.
